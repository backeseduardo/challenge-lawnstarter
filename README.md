# LawnStarter Challenge

This project requires that you should have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed at your machine.

To run the project execute the following line in the command line at the project root.

```
docker-compose up --build
```

After you see the message `You can now view app in the browser` in the command line you may access `http://localhost:3000` at your browser.

**Hold up!**

Ensure that `./run-migrations.sh` has execution permission (`chmod +x ./run-migrations.sh`).

After thatm run `./run-migrations.sh`, this will run the database migrations.

Enjoy it :)

## Short Answer questions

1. I'm hoping to find a place with people of different experiences and backgrounds, and who wants to share knowledge.

2. LawnStarter is a business that is growing and expanding, and this means lots of challenges that I'm willing to help with.

3. Actually, I've been working like this all my career.

4. I'm hoping to learn more about APIs observability and server's observability. Also, I'm looking forward to learning more about PHP 8. I'm curious about everything, so I hope to learn a lot.

## Feedback

1. I enjoyed making a full solution, doing frontend is something that I feel that I'm not good at but I enjoy it.

2. It's a short deadline to complete the challenge for me because I'm currently working, but it's ok since you guys may see how I can handle deadlines.

3. The third requirement could be more specific.
